# StarSckit
This project implements Decision Tree and Support Vector machine classifiers to analyze RRLyrae star data, using Scikit-learn for model training, evaluation, and cross-validation. The dataset includes RRLyrae_labels.txt, which provides classification labels. 
Performance is assessed with 5-fold cross-validation and confusion matrices. This project demonstrates skills in machine learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation with Python.
